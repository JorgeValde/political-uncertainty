Road Map for the Political Uncertainty Project
File contains Summer 2020 RA work

I worked on installing Git and learning the basic commands to submit the Literature Review (pdf and tex) files to github 
I moved the first version of the Literature review from .doc to .tex
I now have 3 versions of the literature review in my backup files, I need to send them to the github repository. 
I got stuck when I was trying to "push" the files to the repository 

July 2 2020
I worked on understanding the request pull command and how it is different in git and github. 
I tried to install and use the command "hub" pull request, but I wasn't able to do this. 
This command works as a pull request for git and it would have solved my problems, but I couldn't install it. 
I solved the problem! the procedure was on the following link 

https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html

I was able to send the 3 versions of the Literature review files to the repository and they were able to merge. 
I'm also sending this .text to the repository to give regular updates on the progress. 

I can only have 1 pull request open on Github, If I try to submit different files to the Github repository, they will enter as commits. 
The professor would have to accept/close the pull request to be able to send a different one. 
There is no problem in submitting different files as commits on an open pull request.

Updated the comments on this file (txt) 
Working on the code:
I created the "Comments.txt" file, which is the "diary" on the work I'll be doing with the code.
I also made some similar comments on the .do file, but I'm assuming those comments will get erase when we fix the issues. 


July 7 2020

I'm reviwing the files in the repository, following the word document "Order of the files.docx"
In the chapter "Generating Vote Data for R" 
There is no "data_7_19_do.do" file on the repository.
There is only the "data_7_19.cvs" file in output.

Then, in the section of the word document 
"Simple Model without Group Indicators"

I open the file "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_code.R" on the repository. This file is in the analysis folder. 
I encounter a problem with the code. It's not a big deal, we would just need to change the disk to the G file. 
I think this is a test. We created "data_7_19.csv" before. 
Line 6 and 8 uses the following direction "C:/Users/yusuf/Desktop/kristy/data_7_19.csv"

Then the file "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_workspace" This is the raw R output file (according to the word doc)
I couldn't find this file in the repository. And it is not been created in the "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_code.R" file. 



Section "Generating Group Indicators'
"11_groups_dummy_do.do" This file is on the build/code folder. 
The code is using "global ROOT "\\stu05-fsrv.ad.syr.edu\ykbagir$\Downloads""
This is Yusuf's work and we can't access the files on his computer.
I would have to check the folder and possible replace this line with the G disk address. 

Worked on the folder political-uncertainty/build/code/vote_numbers_maplight_do.do
I fixed the problem with destring, it should be clear in the pull request 
I have a problem with the code, in line 64, 72 and 73 the code is sending the output to the E disk. 
There is not E disk. 
The excel file is already constructed and has the output of the code. It is located in:
G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\SOP-kbuzard-S13\Admin\Combined files\vote_numbers_maplight.xlsx
The problem is that, I can't reproduce it if its on the E disk.
The code runs, because the excel file is already in the G folder with the old information. 
This means that the output it has it's from Jack's work. Does NOT get updated when we run the code now. 
Lines 86 and 94 update the excel file in the G disk, this happens because in those lines we are not making any reference 
to the E disk. 
I need to be completely sure that the code in line 64, 72 and 73 is creating the excel file. 
export excel x1 using "E:\work order\vote_numbers_maplight.xlsx", sheet("sheet1") sheetmodify cell(C1) firstrow(variables)

If the excel file already exists I need to find it, if its creating it, then I guess we can just create it in the G disk. 
Need to spend some time rechecking this.

We are looking to track the data and see if we are able to update it to current times.
 
maplight_bill_position.dta 
This data set is download from https://maplight.org/data_guide but I need a key to access it. 
The most updated data (according to the webpage) is the 114th session of the United States Congress (2015-2016).

The parameters on this data set are:
legislative_session, bill_number, bill_topic, bill_description, motion, action_id, vote_roll, date, position, org_name, sector, 
industry, business, OS_catcode, maplight_url

maplight_votes.dta
It was email to professor Buzard according to one of the earlier doc files on Onedrive. 

The parameters are: 
action_id, politician_id, fullname, party, vote

Both are merged by action_id.


Poole's data set (it is not been used in Yimin's program)
Can be downloaded from https://voteview.com/data

There is a clear description of the data in the help link. The most updates congress data is for 116th (2019 to 2021)
"This data includes every vote taken by every member in the selected congresses and chambers along with the probability 
we assign to the member taking the position they did. Members are indexed by their ICPSR ID number."

The parameters are:
congress, chamber, rollnumber, icpsr, cast_code, prob


This website also have the following datasets
*Congressional Votes: "This data includes the result and ideological parameters of every vote taken in the selected congresses and chambers. 
This is information about the vote itself, not individual members positions." 
*Members Ideology: "This data includes basic biographical information (state, district, party, name) and ideological scores for 
members of the selected congresses."
*Congressional parties: "This data includes ideological mean and median scores for congressional parties in the selected congresses and chambers."




We have determined that the most updated work comes from the file "REPLICATION", instead of the word document 
"Order of the Files". "Order of the Files" details the initial steps of the proccess, while 'REPLICATION" uses the RSTAN command
to increase efficiency. It also solves the problem with the "destring" command in the previuos version. 
The "destring" command made the mistake of deleting the prefix of bills (H, HR, ...) therefore, it was treating different bills as 
if they were one. Example, bill numbers H2 and HR2. The "destring" command called both bills as 2, treating them as the same for merging
with the votes.dta data set. 
The previous problem is fixed with RSTAN, given that it is not using "destring".

I run the first two programs correctly. 

The names and locations of these programs are:

Generate_vote_data_for_R.do
Generate_group_dummy_by_action.do
Both are in the github rep and the G disk inside the folder:
political-uncertainty/build/code/

The RStan_model.R is located also in the github rep and the G disk in the folder:
political-uncertainty/analysis/code/


I keep encountering the same problem when I run line 104, in the RStan_model.R file. 

"Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "w") :
  cannot open file 'C:\Users\javaldeb\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp2veS6l\file4dbc4163331': No such file or directory"

Troubleshooting this I found different solutions, but non have worked yet. The most possible one is that I do not have writting access, 
but I think I have. I've set the working directory again, as someone mentioned, but no luck. Restarted RStudioand, reinstalled the packages.
Everything up to that part works perfectly. 

I checked the documentation for the STAN command, and I think the code is well written in line 37 (I meant it is not commented out, its just the syntax)
and its generating a vector of values that it is called back in line 105. Which is where I get the error described before. 


I received a key to update the data set from Maplight, but after following the link given by the person sending me the key, 
I wasn't able to correctly download the information. The website is difficult to navigate. 
The API key is: 8d6d8a79f2f3df97ef128dbfea969a82
