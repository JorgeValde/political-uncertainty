I worked on installing Git and learning the basic commands to submit the Literature Review (pdf and tex) files to github 
I moved the first version of the Literature review from .doc to .tex
I now have 3 versions of the literature review in my backup files, I need to send them to the github repository. 
I got stuck when I was trying to "push" the files to the repository

I worked on understanding the request pull command and how it is different in git and github. 
I tried to install and use the command "hub" pull request, but I wasn't able to do this. 
This command works as a pull request for git and it would have solved my problems, but I couldn't install it. 
I solved the problem! the procedure was on the following link 

https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html

I was able to send the 3 versions of the Literature review files to the repository and they were able to merge. 
I'm also sending this .text to the repository to give regular updates on the progress.

Updated the comments on this file (txt) 
Working on the code:
I created the "Comments.txt" file, which is the "diary" on the work I'll be doing with the code.
I also made some similar comments on the .do file, but I'm assuming those comments will get erase when we fix the issues.

I'm reviwing the files in the repository, following the word document "Order of the files.docx"
In the chapter "Generating Vote Data for R" 
There is no "data_7_19_do.do" file on the repository.
There is only the "data_7_19.cvs" file in output.

Then, in the section of the word document 
"Simple Model without Group Indicators"

I open the file "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_code.R" on the repository. This file is in the analysis folder. 
I encounter a problem with the code. It's not a big deal, we would just need to change the disk to the G file. 
I think this is a test. We created "data_7_19.csv" before. 
Line 6 and 8 uses the following direction "C:/Users/yusuf/Desktop/kristy/data_7_19.csv"

Then the file "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_workspace" This is the raw R output file (according to the word doc)
I couldn't find this file in the repository. And it is not been created in the "simple_without_group_5000_2ch_code.R" file. 



Section "Generating Group Indicators'
"11_groups_dummy_do.do" This file is on the build/code folder. 
The code is using "global ROOT "\\stu05-fsrv.ad.syr.edu\ykbagir$\Downloads""
I would have to check the folder and possible replace this line with the G disk address. 

Worked on the folder political-uncertainty/build/code/vote_numbers_maplight_do.do
I fixed the problem with destring, it should be clear in the pull request 
I have a problem with the code, in line 64, 72 and 73 the code is sending the output to the E disk. 
There is not E disk. 
The excel file is already constructed and has the output of the code. It is located in:
G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\SOP-kbuzard-S13\Admin\Combined files\vote_numbers_maplight.xlsx
The problem is that, I can't reproduce it if its on the E disk.
The code runs, because the excel file is already in the G folder with the old information. 
This means that the output it has it's from Jack's work. Does NOT get updated when we run the code now. 
Lines 86 and 94 update the excel file in the G disk, this happens because in those lines we are not making any reference 
to the E disk. 
I need to be completely sure that the code in line 64, 72 and 73 is creating the excel file. 
export excel x1 using "E:\work order\vote_numbers_maplight.xlsx", sheet("sheet1") sheetmodify cell(C1) firstrow(variables)

If the excel file already exists I need to find it, if its creating it, then I guess we can just create it in the G disk. 
Need to spend some time rechecking this.
