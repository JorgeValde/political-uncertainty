Line 23
>destring bill_number , ignore("H ", "HC ", "HJ ", "HR ") replace

The destring command is outdated in Stata 14, therefore we need to replace the argument. 
The syntax of destring changed in Stata 14 so that it could work better with Unicode. 
The new syntax allows an option within the ignore() option, so the second comma causes the error.
The correct code is:
>destring bill_number, replace force ignore("H HC HJ HR ")

This will produce the right result.

We do the same for line 30. The correct code is:
>destring bill, replace force ignore("S CON RES S MOTION JOURNAL H RES H R H J RES H CON RES ADJOURN")


Line 57
>duplicates drop (
This has an open bracket that never close. Do not affect the next line. I think we should remove it. 

Line 64, 72 and 73 
There is no E disk, therefore I can't export to the excel file. 
The excel that we are using is on the G disk and the output from lines 86 and 94 is been save there.
G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\SOP-kbuzard-S13\Admin\Combined files\vote_numbers_maplight.xlsx

The code runs with no problem if we do the previos changes. The problem remains to figure it the E disk.
